   - For downloading gradle dependecies (without which the project will NOT build successfully)
2. Pull the project from https://github.com/mbwika/StudentsPortal and sync it, using Android Studio.
3. Connect an Android phone API>=23(Marshmallow) and run app (Shift+F10) to install it in the phone. You might need to download and install appropriate IMEO drivers for your phone for Android Device Bridge (ADB) to recognize it.
